Web service that accepts http requests and returns responses based on the condition outlined in the next section.

You can use any language and frameworks you choose.

We must be able to run your web service; provide any documentation necessary to accomplish this as part of the repository you submit.

Please assume the user has not executed an application in your language/framework before when developing your documentation.

What does it need to do?
Accept a string as input and return a response indicating whether a word is a pyramid word. A word is a pyramid word if you can arrange the letters in increasing frequency, starting with 1 and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.

Examples
banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's.
bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.
How do I submit it?
Provide a link to a public repository, such as GitHub or BitBucket, that contains your code to your recruiter.
